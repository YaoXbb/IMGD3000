Hi, I am Yao. I design a 3D architectural building game based on my research demanding. The name of my game is VAL world, which means you can visualize any building from you mind in the game. When we boot the game, you are in the first view, and can start to build. I design 8 architectural materials with floor, wall, door, and stair now, you can pick them with number 1 and so on. And click the left to place them. The floor could be automatically adsorpted in the glass, and wall and door can adsorp and rotate to fit the building. Compare to before, I fix the light, make it color light. I fix the problem of dispearance of floor when we put stair. Then I add the walking action code for the NPC make them real walking. I plan to add more material, develop AR/VR building game and introduce artificial intelligence in the future. I hope you can have fun in VAL world.
